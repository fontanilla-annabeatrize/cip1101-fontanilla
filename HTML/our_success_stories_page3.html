        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2>Bailey</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../DOGS/kid.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Bailey was found as a newborn puppy alone in a box along a street near our sanctuary. She was taken in by a concerned netizen after feeling worried for her safety, since she still had blood on her body, and she looked like she wasn't able to feed from her mother. We hurriedly took her to the nearest vet to get her to feel better before we took her in to our sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Weeks after she was taken in, she was as healthy as any other puppy. She loved getting cuddles from our team members, and never left the arms of her new owner: a young kid with her parents. She finally got a home after her disastrous entrance in the world.</p>

        <h2>Sofie</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../DOGS/dog10.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Sofie was taken in after a concerned citizen brought her in. It was said that they knew the dog, because she used to be a police dog that went to their neighbor's house one time. The concerned citizen was suprised when they saw Sofie just wondering about the streets of their neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Even though we took care of her, it felt like she took care of us instead. She served as a bodyguard to all the little dogs in our society, and was often seen hanging out with them.</p>
            <p>She was taken home by an old man who wanted a companion since his kids all moved out of his house. They joyfully headed home when Sofie's papers were done arranging.</p>
