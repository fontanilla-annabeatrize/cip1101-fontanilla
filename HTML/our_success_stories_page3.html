        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="berry">Berry</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/berry.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Berry was taken in by a couple of our team members after it was reported that she has been lost for 2 weeks, and no one was looking for her.</p>
            <p>She was a joyous little puppy, and she stayed with us for a couple of years. She finally got to go home with a young girl with her parents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="nessa">Nessa</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog1.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Nessa was a service dog who accompanied a police who recently died. Her owner's neighbors were surprised seeing Nessa wandering the streets, so they took her to our sanctuary. She would always protect the other dogs, especially the little and frail ones when they would get in an occassional fight with the other pets. She was very disciplined, and knew all the known tricks that dog owners teach their pets.</p>
            <p>She was later adopted by an old woman, and the two happily went home after the paper arrangements.</p>

        <h2 id="milo">Milo</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/felix.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Milo was a stray who was taken in by a team member's neighbor who knew about our sanctuary's existence.</p>
            <p>Aside from Milky, Milo was also one of the older dogs in our sanctuary. Because he was younger, he was able to play more with the other dogs. He loved getting cuddles from other dogs, as well as some of the cats, and our team members.</p>
            <p>Milo was able to go home when a young man came in with another dog, and was looking for someone who can play with his dog. The young man and Milo were a perfect match, and they played for a little bit before his papers were arranged, and they went home happily.</p>

        <h2 id="kkami">Kkami</h2>
        <div class="sstories" class="successtories_img">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/kid.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Kkami was found in a dumpster by a concerned citizen, who then brought him in our sanctuary. He was covered in mud, and was distand from our team members. It took some time for him to adjust to the new environment, because wasn't used to getting pampered. He was very frail.</p>
            <p>Weeks after he was taken it, he slowly opened up to us and the other dogs as well. He even made cat friends, and would visit their division often.</p>
            <p>He was adopted by one of our team members later on, and we still see them often.</p>

        <h2 id="bailey">Bailey</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/kid.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Bailey was found as a newborn puppy alone in a box along a street near our sanctuary. She was taken in by a concerned netizen after feeling worried for her safety, since she still had blood on her body, and she looked like she wasn't able to feed from her mother. We hurriedly took her to the nearest vet to get her to feel better before we took her in to our sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Weeks after she was taken in, she was as healthy as any other puppy. She loved getting cuddles from our team members, and never left the arms of her new owner: a young kid with her parents. She finally got a home after her disastrous entrance in the world.</p>
