        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2>Boomer</h2>
        <div class="sstories" >
            <img src="../MEDIA/DOGS/dogincar.png" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Boomer was brought in from the streets by a concerned young woman who lived along the neighborhood where he was seen. When he came in, he was ecstatic to be showered, and to be basically taken care of by our team. He would finish the bowl we would give him in seconds. That was how deprived of care Boomer was.</p>
            <p>Boomer also loved a green toy plush in particular, similar to the <emp>Three Peas in a Pod</emp> toy from the movie <emp>"Toy's Story".</emp> Sometimes, he would not let the other dogs play with it, only when he wants to play with the other dogs.</p>
            <p>A kid came in with both of his parents, and they told us that they wanted to adopt a dog for their son as a 7th birthday gift. When we showed them around, Boomer greeted the kid, and was asking to play with him. Both of them played for a few minutes, and the young boy finally decided that he wanted to take Boomer home.</p>
            <p>Finally, Boomer has his own Andy, and they were able to go home happily.</p>

        <h2>Sun, Moon, and Ray</h2>
        <div class="sstories" >
            <img src="../MEDIA/DOGS/three dogs.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Sun, Moon, and Ray are siblings who came to our sanctuary through our leader's friend who saw them in a box as puppies. They were our longest babies, and were considered the <emp>Thre Musketeers</emp> of our sanctuary.</p>
            <p>The other dogs in our sanctuary would gather around and play around Sun, Moon, and Ray, especially when the three of them were all together.</p>
            <p>Our sanctuary was a little sad when no one wanted to take our three musketeers home. We were worried, as their age kept adding up, and they did not have any time left.</p>
            <p>Our prayers were finally heard when they were able to go home with an old man who was willing to take care of them. </p>

        <h2>Berry</h2>
        <div class="sstories" >
            <img src="../MEDIA/DOGS/berry.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Berry was taken in by a couple of our team members after it was reported that she has been lost for 2 weeks, and no one was looking for her.</p>
            <p>She was a joyous little puppy, and she stayed with us for a couple of years. She finally got to go home with a young girl with her parents.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Milo</h2>
        <div class="sstories" >
            <img src="../MEDIA/DOGS/felix.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Milo was a stray who was taken in by a team member's neighbor who knew about our sanctuary's existence.</p>
            <p>Aside from Milky, Milo was also one of the older dogs in our sanctuary. Because he was younger, he was able to play more with the other dogs. He loved getting cuddles from other dogs, as well as some of the cats, and our team members.</p>
            <p>Milo was able to go home when a young man came in with another dog, and was looking for someone who can play with his dog. The young man and Milo were a perfect match, and they played for a little bit before his papers were arranged, and they went home happily.</p>

        <h2>Kkami</h2>
        <div class="sstories" class="successtories_img">
            <img src="../MEDIA/DOGS/kid.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Kkami was found in a dumpster by a concerned citizen, who then brought him in our sanctuary. He was covered in mud, and was distand from our team members. It took some time for him to adjust to the new environment, because wasn't used to getting pampered. He was very frail.</p>
            <p>Weeks after he was taken it, he slowly opened up to us and the other dogs as well. He even made cat friends, and would visit their division often.</p>
            <p>He was adopted by one of our team members later on, and we still see them often.</p>
