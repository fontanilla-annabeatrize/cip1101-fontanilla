            <p>Boomer was brought in from the streets by a concerned young woman who lived along the neighborhood where he was seen. When he came in, he was ecstatic to be showered, and to be basically taken care of by our team. He would finish the bowl we would give him in seconds. That was how deprived of care Boomer was.</p>
            <p>Boomer also loved a green toy plush in particular, similar to the <emp>Three Peas in a Pod</emp> toy from the movie <emp>"Toy's Story".</emp> Sometimes, he would not let the other dogs play with it, only when he wants to play with the other dogs.</p>
            <p>A kid came in with both of his parents, and they told us that they wanted to adopt a dog for their son as a 7th birthday gift. When we showed them around, Boomer greeted the kid, and was asking to play with him. Both of them played for a few minutes, and the young boy finally decided that he wanted to take Boomer home.</p>
            <p>Finally, Boomer has his own Andy, and they were able to go home happily.</p>
