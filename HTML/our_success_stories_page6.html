        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="milk">Milk</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/milk.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Milk was a stray cat found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. We were immediately captivated by her very upturned, crystal blue eyes. However, she was frail as a stick. She looked like she hadn't eaten in days.</p>
            <p>After pampering her, she was able to mingle for a bit with other cats. Our visitors would also be immediately drawn to her, but they always felt afraid to take her home because of her piercing gaze that made her look intimidating. But to us, she was a cat that loved to be dependent and was always seen sticking to one of our team members.</p>
            <p>She was finally taken home by a young man who wasn't deceived by her looks, and she didn't leave his arms when they met for the first time.</p>

        <h2 id="mia">Mia</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat7.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Mia was taken in after the team went on its annual retreat. A team member approached a stray cat, and noticed that she was skinny and had fleas in her fur. The team member was concerned for her well-being, so they went home together after the retreat ended.</p>
            <p>Mia loved playing with our sanctuary's toys, as well as the other cats. She was finally able to go home with a young couple who connected immediately with her as soon as they stepped in the room.</p>

        <h2 id="mami">Mami</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/hyunseung.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Mami was a stray cat who imprinted herself on one of our team members that took her in because they found out that she was pregnant. When she was taken into our sanctuary, she was constantly coming to us, especially when she was hungry. She would also always ask us for pets, because she loved them. When her kittens were born, it didn't stop her from cuddling with us. The whole family of cats were adopted. </p>

        <h2 id="bobby">Bobby</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/dori.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Bobby was a stray who was taken in by a team member's neighbor who was aware of the existence of our refuge. He was able to play with the other dogs more because he was younger. He adored being cuddled by other cats and our staff members. When a young guy with another dog came in wanting to get someone to play with, Bobby was able to go home. Bobby and the man looked like long best friends , and they played for a while until the little fella's papers were sorted and they went home happy.</p>

        <h2 id="commegarcon">Comme and Garcon</h2>
        <div class="stories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/duo.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Comme and Garcon were two cats who stuck together when they were wandering the streets. A concerned citizen decided to bring them both into our sanctuary to provide them with shelter. These two were very sociable from the get-go. They were inseparable, from taking baths to going out for playtime.</p>
            <p>Comme and Garcon were both adopted by an old couple. They were looking for pets to adopt, since all of their children were now out of their house. When they looked around, they admired how Comme and Garcon were like two peas in a pod. They arranged their papers and were able to go home immediately after some playtime. </p>
