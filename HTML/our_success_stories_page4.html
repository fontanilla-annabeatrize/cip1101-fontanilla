        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2>Sofie</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog10.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sofie was taken in after a concerned citizen brought her in. It was said that they knew the dog, because she used to be a police dog that went to their neighbor's house one time. The concerned citizen was suprised when they saw Sofie just wondering about the streets of their neighborhood.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though we took care of her, it felt like she took care of us instead. She served as a bodyguard to all the little dogs in our society, and was often seen hanging out with them.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was taken home by an old man who wanted a companion since his kids all moved out of his house. They joyfully headed home when Sofie's papers were done arranging.</p>           
        </div>
        <h2 id="jinnie">Jinnie</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog12.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jinnie was taken in after he was seen wandering the streets of a concerned citizen's neighborhood. They mentioned having Jinnie come to their house frequently for food, and noticed that he had fleas all over his fur.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elderly guy took her home since he needed a friend since his children had all moved out. When Sofie's paperwork were finished, they happily returned home.</p>        
        </div>
        <h2 id="mica">Mica</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog13.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mica was found by one of our team members when they were on the way home from work. She was shaking uncontrollably because she was hungry, and was completely dirty. He looked lost. Our team member decided to take her in, and we took care of him.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was taken home by a middle aged woman with her kid.</p>>        
        </div>
        <h2 id="Baby">Baby</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog14.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baby was taken in to our sanctuary after being homeless for 2 years after her previous owners decided to abandon her after bringing home a new baby. When she came in, she was very excited when she saw other dogs, and especially the food she was about to eat. She was known as a dog who loved pictorials, and would pose every time a camera points her way.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was later adopted by a high-profile celebrity who loved adopting stray pets.</p>
