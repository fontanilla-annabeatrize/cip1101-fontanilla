        <h2>Sofie</h2>

            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog10.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Sofie was taken in after a concerned citizen brought her in. It was said that they knew the dog, because she used to be a police dog that went to their neighbor's house one time. The concerned citizen was suprised when they saw Sofie just wondering about the streets of their neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Even though we took care of her, it felt like she took care of us instead. She served as a bodyguard to all the little dogs in our society, and was often seen hanging out with them.</p>
            <p>She was taken home by an old man who wanted a companion since his kids all moved out of his house. They joyfully headed home when Sofie's papers were done arranging.</p>

            <p>Jinnie was taken in after he was seen wandering the streets of a concerned citizen's neighborhood. They mentioned having Jinnie come to their house frequently for food, and noticed that he had fleas all over his fur. </p>
