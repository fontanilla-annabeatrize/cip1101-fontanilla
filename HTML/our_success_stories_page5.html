        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="margot">Margot</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog15.jpg" alt="dog" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sofie was taken in after a concerned citizen brought her in. It was said that they knew the dog, because she used to be a neighbor's dog that frequently went to the citizen's house. The concerned citizen was suprised when they saw Margot just wondering about the streets of their neighborhood.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was often seen hanging out with the other pets in our sanctuary. She was taken home by an old man who wanted a companion since his kids all moved out of his house. They joyfully headed home when Margot's papers were done arranging.</p>

        <h2 id="jimmy">Jimmy</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog16.jpg" alt="dog" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy was taken in by our team members as a favor for her neighbor, who was dying of cancer. She served as a guard dog, but was temporarily strayed from her home. Our team member, who found Jimmy, took her back to her owner, and was advised to go straight to our sanctuary.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy loved meeting people and playing with them. She was taken home by a young man who just moved in from another place, and wanted to adopt a dog for his kids.</p>

        <h2 id="bobby">Bobby</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog17.jpg" alt="dog" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby was found by one of our team members when they were on the way home from work. He was shaking uncontrollably because he was hungryHe looked lost. Our team member decided to take him in, and we took care of him.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in his late 60s decided to check our organization in hopes that he will finally find his lost beloved pet. We showed him our garden where the pets were currently in play time, and his eyes widened in awe when he saw Bobby. They went home immediately.</p>

        <h2 id="joey">Joey</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog18.jpg" alt="dog" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joey was given to us by an expecting couple who cannot afford to take care of a dog because of the upcoming baby. The couple was scared that no one would take care of Joey because of his old age  but they had no choice. We assured them that we are going to give dear Joey the best care possible until his last breath.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joey was a very happy dog. Despite not being able to fully run and play like the other dogs, he liked meeting new people and has established a great relationship with our team. He would happily bark when we came to her cage for food, or when she needed a bath. Joey even played a bit with the other dogs, but she mostly served as a mother to all the other dogs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was adopted by a young man who wanted a pet regardless if it was an old dog or a puppy. The two met, and Joey was able to go home with the young man.</p>
