        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="cardo">Cardo</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/seungmin2.jpg" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardo was taken in 2 years ago by an elderly couple who was close to dying. The elderly couple found our organization through their son-in-law's recommendation. When Cardo was left alone by the elderly couple, he was distant, did not eat any of the food we gave him, and was sulky for a period of time. During play time, he did not socialize with the other dogs. Days passed, and he was warming up to our team. He slowly ate, and was able to mingle with some of our other dogs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man in his 20s came in and was looking for a dog to adopt. After a few minutes of looking at the dogs, he locked eyes with our beloved Cardo. We were able to capture the moment when these two met. It felt like two old friends who finally met after a long time. This was the only time when Cardo was able to happily socialize with the young man. The man was mimicking barking noises to Cardo, who was curious at first, but played with the man.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon enough, the young man was able to take Cardo home. Cardo was happily wiggling his tail while his new furparent arranged the adoption papers, and they were able to go home.</p>

        <h2 id="bruce">Bruce</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dog2.jpg" alt="Bruce" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce was taken in by an old couple who were near death two years ago. Our business was recommended to the elderly couple by their son-in-law. He seemed aloof, refused to eat any of the food we offered him, and was grumpy for a while after the old couple left him alone.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man in his late teens came in hoping to adopt a puppy. He locked eyes with Bruce after a few minutes of staring at the dogs.
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man was soon able to take his new baby home. Bruce was joyously wagging his tail as his new furparent completed the adoption paperwork.</p>

        <h2 id="milky">Milky</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/seungmin.jpg" alt="Milky" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milky was given to us by an expecting couple who cannot afford to take care of a dog because of the upcoming baby. The couple was scared that no one would take care of Milky because of her old age  but they had no choice. We assured them that we are going to give dear Milky the best care possible until her last breath.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milky was a very happy dog. Despite not being able to fully run and play like the other dogs, she liked meeting new people and has established a great relationship with our team. She would happily bark when we came to her cage for food, or when she needed a bath. Milky even played a bit with the other dogs, but she mostly served as a mother to all the other dogs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was adopted by a young man who wanted a pet regardless if it was an old dog or a puppy. The two met, and Milky was able to go home with the young man.</p>

        <h2 id="rico">Rico</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/dogonfloor.jpg" alt="Rico" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rico was found by one of our team members when they were on the way home from work. He was shaking uncontrollably because he was hungry, and was completely dirty. He looked lost. Our team member decided to take him in, and we took care of him.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in his late 40s decided to check our organization in hopes that he will finally find his lost beloved pet. We showed him our garden where the pets were currently in play time, and his eyes widened in awe when he saw Rico.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It felt like hours, but the man stayed in our sanctuary to play with Rico. They were able to go home after some time.</p>

        <h2 id="cookie">Cookie</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/DOGGALLERY/doorinwindow.jpg" alt="Cookie" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookie was taken in by our team members as a favor for her neighbor, who was dying of cancer. She served as a guard dog, but was temporarily strayed from her home. Our team member, who found Cookie, took her back to her owner, and was advised to go straight to our sanctuary.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookie loved meeting people and playing with them. She was taken home by a young woman who just moved in from another place, and wanted to adopt a dog for her home.</p>
