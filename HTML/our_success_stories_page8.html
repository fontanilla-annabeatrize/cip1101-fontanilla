        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="sooniedoongiedori">Soonie, Doongie, Dori</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/soonie doongie dori.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Soonie, Doongie, and Dori were all taken in by a concerned citizen who frequently saw them wandering the streets of their neighborhood.</p>
            <p>They were never seen being away from one another. They slept, ate, and played together, along with the other pets in our sanctuary. Because they were all so difficult to separate, our sanctuary decided that they cannot be adopted as one or two.</p>
            <p>Luckily, a little kid, together with his mother, decided to adopt them all together.</p>     
        </div>
        <h2 id="tsuki">Tsuki</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat3.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Tsuki was a stray found around the nearby school. She was given to us by the school's principal because a student's parents deemed her dangerous to their child. She couldn't let go of the principal, but it was for the best.</p>
            <p>Tsuki was also one of our cuddliest cats. Fortunately, she was taken immediately after a kid came in with his mother, and Tsuki couldn't stop circling around his legs. We found out that the kid was a student from the school, and Tsuki was his favorite cat.</p>

        <h2 id="chester">Chester</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat8.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Chester was taken in as a stray by a concerned citizen. As soon as he left the citizen's arms, he ran around the sanctuary and played with the cats. He was known to be a fast runner, and was always seen chasing a ball, a mouse, or a balloon.</p>
            <p>Chester was very good in mini pet games. He would always win against the other cats, but outside the battlefield, he was a goofy little cat. From the get-go, he allowed team members to touch his belly, which is unusual behavior for a cat.</p>

        <h2 id="garfie">Garfie</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/soonie2.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Our team members took Garfie in by a concerned citizen as a kindness for her dying neighbor. She loved getting cuddles from team members, and would always beg them for food, even if she already finished eating.</p>
            <p>Garfie enjoyed meeting and playing with new people. A young father who had recently moved in and wanted to adopt a cat for his children took her home.</p>

        <h2 id="mia">Mia</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat1.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Mia was taken in by one of our team members when she was seen alone and shaking in the back of an alley. She would wimper when we tried to go near her, but after a few days, she warmed up to us. She would finish two to three bowls of food. She was shy around the other pets, but would also play with them occassionally.</p>
            <p>She was adopted by a young couple, and after arranging her papers, Mia jumped in their arms.</p>
