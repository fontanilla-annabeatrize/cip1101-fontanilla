        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="sam">Sam</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat2.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam was a stray cat found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. We were immediately captivated by her very upturned, warm orange eyes. However, she was very skinny. She looked like she hadn't eaten in days.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pampering her, she was able to mingle for a bit with other cats. She was a cat that loved to be cuddled and be fed.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was finally taken home by a young man who was amazed by how cuddly she was</p>         
        </div>
        <h2 id="chris">Chris</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/soonie.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris was a stray cat found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. he looked like she hadn't eaten in days. Because of that, the concerned citizen brought him in.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team loved cuddling with him because he was a very chubby cat. He loved getting his bottom spanked by team members like a drum. He would meow to the team members when they would stop/</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was finally taken home by a young man who was amazed by how cuddly he was.</p>         
        </div>
        <h2 id="lixie">Lixie</h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/doongie3.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lixie was a cat who wandered around the streets 5 miles away from our sanctuary. He was found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. he looked like she hadn't eaten in days. Because of that, the concerned citizen brought him in.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of all the cats in the sanctuary, he was the most cuddly. However, he hated getting wet by water the most. After being fed by our team members, he would feed the kittens around the sanctuary. Other than that, he would just mind his own business.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, he was adopted by a high profile actress who visited our sanctuary often.</p>

        <h2 id="Maggie"></h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/dori2.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie was a stray cat found inside a dumpster near the local church. She was brought in by one of the church's sister, because she knew we can take care of her. After she was cleaned and fed, she proceeded to play with the other cats. We are used to seeing newcomers being shy and distant, but Maggie was different.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was also one of our pets who was very photogenic and loved taking photos. Our team members would dress up our pets occassionally, and she was the only one who didn't remove her clothes after 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was later adopted by a young man.</p>

        <h2 id="Sky"></h2>
        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat6.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky was a stray who was taken in by an old man, who told us that he liked to hide in his garage. Because he was allergic to cats, he couldn't take care of him. He was taken in immediately before the man started fully sneezing.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky loved taking walks with our team members. His favorite place was the nearby park where kids would play tennis and do picnics. He loved seeing nature.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was later taken home by a little kid who wanted a new pet.</p>
