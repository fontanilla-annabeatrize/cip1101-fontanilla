        <h1>Our Success Stories</h1>
        <h2 id="sam">Sam</h2>

            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/cat2.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Sam was a stray cat found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. We were immediately captivated by her very upturned, warm orange eyes. However, she was very skinny. She looked like she hadn't eaten in days.</p>
            <p>After pampering her, she was able to mingle for a bit with other cats. She was a cat that loved to be cuddled and be fed.</p>
            <p>She was finally taken home by a young man who was amazed by how cuddly she was</p>

        <h2 id="chris">Chris</h2>

            <p>Chris was a stray cat found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. he looked like she hadn't eaten in days. Because of that, the concerned citizen brought him in.</p>
            <p>Our team loved cuddling with him because he was a very chubby cat. He loved getting his bottom spanked by team members like a drum. He would meow to the team members when they would stop/</p>
            <p>He was finally taken home by a young man who was amazed by how cuddly he was.</p>

        <div class="sstories">
            <img src="../IMAGES/CATGALLERY/doongie3.jpg" alt="cat" class="successtories_img">
            <p>Lixie was a cat who wandered around the streets 5 miles away from our sanctuary. He was found by a concerned citizen, who said that they saw him wandering around our sanctuary. he looked like she hadn't eaten in days. Because of that, the concerned citizen brought him in.</p>
            <p>Out of all the cats in the sanctuary, he was the most cuddly. However, he hated getting wet by water the most. After being fed by our team members, he would feed the kittens around the sanctuary. Other than that, he would just mind his own business.</p>
            <p>Later on, he was adopted by a high profile actress who visited our sanctuary often.</p>
