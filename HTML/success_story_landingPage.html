            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardo was taken in 2 years ago by an elderly couple who was close to dying. The elderly couple found our organization through their son-in-law's recommendation. When Cardo was left alone by the elderly couple, he was distant, did not eat any of the food we gave him, and was sulky for a period of time. During play time, he did not socialize with the other dogs. Days passed, and he was warming up to our team. He slowly ate, and was able to mingle with some of our other dogs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man in his 20s came in and was looking for a dog to adopt. After a few minutes of looking at the dogs, he locked eyes with our beloved Cardo. We were able to capture the moment when these two met. It felt like two old friends who finally met after a long time. This was the only time when Cardo was able to happily socialize with the young man. The man was mimicking barking noises to Cardo, who was curious at first, but played with the man.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon enough, the young man was able to take Cardo home. Cardo was happily wiggling his tail while his new furparent arranged the adoption papers, and they were able to go home.</p>
